# User simulator for chatbot testing

## Description
The evolution of technology increased the complexity of chatbots, and also it's testing methods. With the introduction of LLMs, chatbots are capable of humanizing
conversations and imitating the pragmatics of natural language. Several approaches have been created in order to evaluate the
performance of chatbots. 

The code in this project allows creating test cases based in conversations that a user simulator will have
with the chatbot to test.

## Usage

In order to run the simulator, a specific chatbot should be deployed previously (i.e. Taskyto, Rasa...). 

The script "autorun.py" contains the functions to load the user simulator profile, start a conversation with the chatbot 
and save this conversation and its configuration parámeters. The user simulator profile is stored in yaml files,
which should be located in some folder (`user_sim/yaml/user_sim_bikesqa.yaml`).

## Environment Configuration

API keys can be set as environment variables.

The most important API key is `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## User Profile YAML Configuration

This file contains all the properties the user will follow in order to carry out the conversation. Since the user simulator is
based in OpenAI GPT4-o LLM technology, some of the fields should be written as prompts in natural language. For these fields, a 
prompt engineering task should be carried out by the tester to narrow down the role of the user simulator and guide its
behaviour. A description of the fields and an example of the YAML structure is described below.

```
test_name: "pizza_order_test_custom"

llm:
  temperature: 0.8
  model: gpt-4o

user:
  language: English
  role: you have to act as a user ordering a pizza to a pizza shop.
  context:

    - your name is Jon Doe
  goals:
    - "a {{size}} custom pizza with {{toppings}}"
    - "{{cans}} cans of {{drink}}"
    - how long is going to take the pizza to arrive
    - how much will it cost

    - size:
        function: another()
        type: string

```

# test_name

Here it is defined the name of the test suit. This name will be assigned to the exported test file and the folder containing the tests.

# llm
  This parameter establishes the characteristics of the llm model. It consists of a dictionary with two fields, "model" and "temperature".
  - model: This parameter indicates the llm model that will carry out the conversation as the user simulator. Models to use should be available in
LangChain's OpenAI module.
  - temperature: This parameter controls the randomness and diversity of the responses generated by the LLM. The value supported is float between 0.0 and 1.0.

  The llm parameter is optional, thus if it is not instantiated in the yaml file, model and temperature will be set 
  to default values, which are gpt-4o and 0.8 respectively.


# user

This field defines the properties of the user simulator in 3 parameters: language, role, context and goals

## language

This parameter defines the main language that will be used in the conversations. If no language is provided, it is set to English by default.

## role

  In this field, the tester should define the role the user will deploy during the conversation as a prompt, according to the chatbot to test.

## context

  This field consist of a list of prompts that will define some characteristics of the user simulator. 
  This can be used to define the name of the user, the availability for an appointment, allergies or intolerances, etc.
  An option for loading predefined "personalities" can be enabled by typing inside of this field "personality:" and the
  path to the YAML file containing the desired personality. These personalities can go along with characteristics added
  by the programmer.

## goals

This field, named "ask_about" in previous versions is used to narrow down the conversation topics the user simulator will carry out with the chatbot. 
It consists of a list of strings and dictionaries.

The tester define a list of prompts with indications for the user simulator to check on the chatbot. 
These prompts can contain variables that should be called inside the text between double brackets {{var}}. 
Variables are useful to provide variability in the testing process and should be instantiated in the list as 
shown in the example above with the exact same name as written between brackets (case-sensitive).

Variables follow a specific structure defined by 3 fields as shown below: data, type and function.
```
goals:
  - "cost estimation for photos of {{number_photo}} artworks"
  - number_photo:
      function: forward()
      type: int
      data:
        step: 2
        min: 1
        max: 6

#      data:             (only with float)
#        steps: 0.2 // linspace: 5 
#        min: 1
#        max: 6
```
  ### type
  This field indicates the type of data that will be substituted in the variable placement. 
  The types available for this version are int, float and string, and must be stated as written here.

  ### data
  Here, the data list to use will be defined. In general, data lists must be defined manually by the user, but there 
  are some cases where it can be created automatically. 

  As shown in the example above, instead of defining a list of the amount of artworks, 
  it is possible to automatically create an integer or float list based on range instructions using a 'min, max, step' structure, 
  where min refers to the minimum value of the list, max refers to the maximum value of the list, 
  and step refers to the separation steps between samples. When working with float data, it can also be used the "linspace" 
  parameter instead of step, where samples will be listed with a linear separation step between them.

  This field also allows the user to create data lists based in prompts by using the function "any()".
```
  - drink:
      function: another()
      type: string
      data:
        - Sprite
        - Coca-Cola
        - Pepsi
        - any(3 soda drinks)
        - any(alcoholic drinks)
```
  By using this function, an LLM creates a list following the instructions provided by the user inside the parenthesis. 
  This function can be used alone in the list or accompanied by other items added by the user. When used with other items,
  the "any()" function will exclude these items from the list generation process in case they're related to the instruction. Multiple
  "any()" functions can be used inside the list.
  Note that if no amount is specified in the prompt, the "any()" function will create a list with an unpredictable amount of items.


  The possibility to add personalized list functions to create data lists is another option available in this field,
  as shown in the example below.

```
  - number:
      function: forward()
      type: int
      data:
        file: list_functions/number_list.py
        function_name: 
        args:
          - 1
          - 6
          - 2

  - pizza_type:
      function: forward()
      type: string
      data:
        file: list_functions/number_list.py
        function_name: shuffle_list
        args: list_functions/list_of_things.yml
```
  In these two examples, a personalized list function is implemented in "data". The structure consist in three parameters:
 - file: The path to the .py file where the function is created
 - function_name: the name of the function to run inside the .py file
 - args: the required input args for the function.

  List functions are fully personalized by the user. 

  ### function
  Functions are useful to determine how data will be added to the prompt.

  Since the data is listed, functions are used to iterate through these lists in order to change the information
  inside the variable in each conversation. The functions available in this update are the following:

- default(): the default() function assigns all data in the list to the variable in the prompt.
- random(): this function picks only one random sample inside the list assigned to the variable.
- random(5): this function picks a certain amount of random samples inside the list. In this example, 5 random 
samples will be picked from the list. This number can't exceed the list length.
- random(rand): this function picks a random amount of random samples inside the list. 
This amount will not exceed the list length.
- another(): the another() function will always randomly pick a different sample until finishing the options.
- forward(): this function iterates through each of the samples in the list one by one. It allows to nest multiple
forward() functions in order to cover all combinations possible. An example of this is shown in the "goals" section
in the main example. To nest forward() functions it is necessary to reference the variable that it is going to nest by typing
its name inside the brackets, as shown in the example below:
```
  goals:
    - "{{cans}} cans of {{drink}}"

    - cans:
        function: forward(drink)
        type: int
        data:
          min: 1
          max: 3
          step: 1

    - drink:
        function: forward()
        type: string
        data:
          - sprite
          - coke
          - Orange Fanta

```

# chatbot

  This field provides information about the chatbot configuration and the data to be obtained from the conversation.

## is_starter

  This parameter defines whether the chatbot will start the conversation or not. The value supported is boolean and 
  will be set depending on the chatbot to test. 

## fallback

  Here, the tester should provide the chatbot's original fallback message in order to allow the user simulator to detect 
  fallbacks. This is needed to avoid fallback loops, allowing the user simulator to rephrase the query or change the topic.

## output

This field helps the tester get some certain information for the conversation once it is finished. It is used for data validation tasks.

The tester defines some certain data to obtain from the conversation in order to validate the consistency and
performance of the chatbot. This output field must follow the structure below:

```
  output:
    - price:
        type: money
        description: The final price of the pizza order
    - time:
        type: time
        description: how long is going to take the pizza to be ready
    - order_id:
        type: str
        description: my order ID
```

A name for the data to output must be defined. Each output must contain these two parameters:

- type: here it is defined the type of value to output. This type can be one of the following:
  - int: Outputs data as an integer.
  - float: Outputs data as a float.
  - money: Outputs data as a monetary value with the currency used during the conversation.
  - str: Outputs data as text.
  - time: Outputs data in a time format.
  - date: Outputs data in a date format.
- description: In this parameter, the tester should prompt a text defining which information has to be obtained from the conversation.


# conversation

  This field defines some parameters that will dictate how the conversations will be generated. It consists 
  of 3 parameters: number, goal_style and interaction_style.

  ```
conversation:
  number: sample(0.2)
  goal_style:
    steps: 5
  interaction_style:
    - random:
      - make spelling mistakes
      - all questions
      - long phrases
      - change language:
          - italian
          - portuguese
          - chinese
  ```

- number: this parameter indicates the number of conversations to generate. A number can be assigned to this field in order to determine a specific amount
of conversations. When nested forward functions are defined in the "goals" field, it is possible to set the "all_combinations" option, so the number
of conversation to generate will be determined by the number of combinations obtained from the nested forward functions.
  ```
  drink:
    function: forward(size)
    type: str
    data:
      - coke
      - Fanta
  
  size:
    function: forward()
    type: str
    data:
      - small
      - medium
      - large
  
  # These "goals" variables will generate 2 x 3 = 6 conversations when "all_combinations" is selected.
  ```
  In the same case, another option named "sample()" is defined on this field. This option allows to generate only a fraction of the total amount 
  of combinations based on a decimal percentage defined inside the brackets.
  In previous example, when the number of conversation parameter is set to sample(0.2), a total amount of 6 x 0.2 = 1.2 ≈ 1 conversation will be generated.
- goal_style: this defines how the conversation should end. There are 3 options in this update
  - steps: the tester should input the number of interactions to be done before the conversation ends.
  - random steps: a random number of interactions will be done between 1 and an amount defined by the user. This amount can't exceed 20.
  - all_answered: the conversation will end as long as all the queries in "goals" have been asked by the user and answered by the chatbot. 
  This option creates an internal data frame that verifies if all "goals" queries are being responded or confirmed, and it is possible to export this
  dataframe once the conversation ended by setting the "export" field as True, as shown in the following example. This field is not mandatory, thus if only
  "all_answered" is defined, the export field is set as False by default.
    When all_answered is set, conversations are regulated with a loop break based on the chatbot's fallback message in order to avoid infinite loops when the chatbot does 
  not know how to answer to several questions made by the user. But, in some cases, this loop break can be dodged due to hallucinations from the chatbot, leading to
  irrelevant and extremely long conversations. To avoid this, a "limit" parameter is implemented in order to give the tester the possibility to stop the conversation
  after a specific amount of interactions in case the loop break was not triggered before or all queries were not answered. This parameter is not mandatory neither and will
  be set to 30 interactions by default.
  ```
  goal_style:
    all_answered:
      export: True
      limit: 20
  ```
  - default: the default mode enables "all_answered" mode with 'export' set as False and 'limit' set to 30, since no steps are defined.
- interaction_style: this indicates how the user simulator should carry out the conversation. There are 7 options in this update
  - long phrase: the user will use very long phrases to write any query.
  - change your mind: the user will change its mind eventually. Useful in conversations when the user has to
                      provide information, such as toppings on a pizza, an appointment date...
  - change language: the user will change the language in the middle of a conversation. This should be defined as a list
                     of languages inside the parameter, as shown in the example above.
  - make spelling mistakes: the user will make typos and spelling mistakes during the conversation
  - single question: the user makes only one query per interaction from "goals" field.
  - all questions: the user asks everything inside the "goals" field in one interaction.
  - random: this options allows to create a list inside of it with any of the interaction styles mentioned above. 
Then, it selects a random amount of interaction styles to apply to the conversation. Here's an example on how to apply this interaction style:
    ```
    interaction_style:
      - random:
        - make spelling mistakes
        - all questions
        - long phrases
        - change language:
            - italian
            - portuguese
            - chinese
    ```
  - default: the user simulator will carry out the conversation in a natural way.
